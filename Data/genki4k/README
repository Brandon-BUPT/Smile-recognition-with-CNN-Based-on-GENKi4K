This is the GENKI 4K dataset, collected by the Machine Perception Laboratory,
University of California, San Diego. This dataset contains 4000 images along 
with expression (smile=1, non-smile=0) labels and pose labels (yaw, pitch, and roll,
in radians). The file "labels.txt" contains these labels, and the Nth line of the
file corresponds to N in the "files" directory.
